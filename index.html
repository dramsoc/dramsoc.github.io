                <h1>Welcome to DramSoc, Imperial's Dramatic Society!</h1>
                <p>We do everything related to theatre: acting, set, costume, lighting, sound, writing, stage management, directing, production, and more. There's plenty to get involved in!</p>
                <p>DramSoc own and operate the full range of state-of-the-art entertainment equipment, and our technical team run events across college, from <a href="https://mtsoc.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MTSoc</a> shows to Summer Ball. We take pride in training our members as theatre technicians, actors and directors. We run weekly workshops, including backstage tours, improvisation, set-building, lighting design, and much more, and many of our alumni graduate to become theatre professionals.</p>
                <p>We stage 2 plays per term, with recent productions including Mike Bartlett's 'Earthquakes in London', and 'Compost', a 5-star piece of original theatre produced at Edinburgh Fringe. We produce a range of work written by students, and established playwrights. This really is the place to be if you love theatre!</p>

Usually our main shows have casts of between 15 and 20 people and we welcome auditions from anyone with any amount of experience, so if you’re thinking of getting involved, keep an eye out for audition posters and notices on our website, social media, and our mailing lists at the start and end of every term.</p>

                    <p>DramSoc decides on each term's shows at a Play Proposals meeting (announced on the DramSoc mailing list) held near to the end of the previous term. A full play proposal includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Representative excerpts from the script</li>
                        <li>Brief synopsis of the play, its genre and style</li>
                        <li>Cast breakdown including M/F & large/medium/small parts</li>
                        <li>Creative vision and possible technical requirements</li>
                        <li>Production team including a director or producer</li>
                        <li>Whether performance rights are available</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A play proposal with all of these things considered is much stronger than one without, but none of these things are mandatory for a proposal. If you have an idea for a proposal, but are unsure about any aspect of the proposal or proposals process, please email the DramSoc President or Acting Director. Additionally, anyone may come to the meeting to observe the process.</p>

                <p>On top of this, we provide sound, lighting and rigging for live events hosted by the Union and other Clubs & Societies, such as the annual Summer Ball, talent shows, live music events and club nights.

                <p>DramSoc provides a wide range of technical services; from plays to musicals, talent shows to outdoor music festival stages, variety shows to the annual Summer Ball, we do it all. We have a large and dedicated crew, and hire out professional lighting and sound equipment, props and set from our extensive stores. In addition, we offer comprehensive production management, consultancy and design services.</p>
                <p>Our experience in production management and design ranges from the large-scale annual Summer Ball, including the lighting and sound in the Great Hall and the Queen's Tower Rooms and all the set and design features, down to small societal events in Metric. As such we believe that you will find our help and advice invaluable whilst planning your event, regardless of its size or complexity.</p>
                <p>Even if you do not use DramSoc's services, we will be more than happy to advise and assist in getting alternative quotes. However, we are quite confident that we care more about the success of your event than a hire company would, and we can deliver more for your money, too. In any case, please try to get in contact with us as early as possible, as the more time we have, the better we can help you.</p>

DramSoc is responsible for the maintenance of the technical aspects of the hall, and it contains a full-featured stage and technical installation, albeit limited by the shape of the building.</p>
